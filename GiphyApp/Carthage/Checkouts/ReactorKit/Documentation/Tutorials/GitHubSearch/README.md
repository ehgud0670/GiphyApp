In this tutorial we'll make a simplified version of [GitHubSearch example](https://github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit/tree/master/Examples/GitHubSearch). You can learn how to implement the basic `View` and `Reactor`. This tutorial is for beginners so it doesn't contain advance usage. Check [Examples](https://github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit#examples) section on README for more examples.
